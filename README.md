Tech-Stack - Unity, C# Programming

About the Project : 

This Project is programmed to be a top-down game with the objective of throwing food to hungry animals - who are stampeding towards you - before they can run past you. 

In order to do this, I learned some of the most important programming and Unity concepts:

1. If-then statements, random value generation, arrays
2. Collision detection
3. Prefabs, and Instantiation
4. Ability to launch projectiles
5. Maneuver the player to keep the game alive
6. How physics work inside Unity
